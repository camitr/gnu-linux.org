What is Bazaar?

Bazaar is a version control system that helps you track project history
over time and to collaborate easily with others. Whether you're a single
developer, a co-located team or a community of developers scattered
across the world, Bazaar scales and adapts to meet your needs. Part of
the GNU Project, Bazaar is free software sponsored by Canonical. For a
closer look, see ten reasons to switch to Bazaar `here`_.
