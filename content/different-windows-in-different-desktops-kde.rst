Unlike GNOME, KDE shows all windows on all desktops. There is simple
setting to surpass this. Right click on any window on panel( minimized
or open) and select Task Manager Settings . From the
General option go to Filters and check two options viz. Only show
tasks from current screen & Only show tasks from current desktop .

Thats it. Now you can have different windows on different desktops.Â
