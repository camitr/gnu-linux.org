Based on my experience i'll suggest here list of best five distro's.This
article is to guide a new migrant & i'm assuming that he or she is non
techie.So let's make it simple,here it goes.

\ **TOP FIVE LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS**\ 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

\ **Number Five**:\ **  (MANDRIVA)**

\ |image0|\ The fifth most favourite Linux with all features
is \ `Mandriva`_ .According to Distrowatch it has around 750+ Hits Per
Day(HPD).It now comes with default KDE edition.Mandriva is based on
RPM(Red Hat Package Management).It has a decent repository & comes with
lots of  preloaded multimedia codecs and drivers.Mandriva has rock solid
base,and support for many commercial add ons.It has frequent release
cycle and good community support.

 

 

 

\ **Number Four:**\ \ **  (OPEN SUSE)**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image1|

The next best thing is \ `Open Suse`_. It's also based on RPM.Comes with
both GNOME & KDE flavor .Unlike Mandriva it doesn't comes with pre
installed multimedia codec's.Though you can drive any software after
 installation.Suse Linux has its own repository which host packages for
many other distro's too. Own by Novell,it has good support for some .NET
development(using MONO ).Things i like most about Suse is its ease of
use & large package base.Beside these Suse is customized for best look &
feel.

 

 

 

 

 

**Number Three:  (FEDORA)**

\ |image2|\ `Fedora Project`_\ \ ` `_\ is sponsored by Red Hat.Fedora
has many similarities to Mandriva & Suse.Fedora is stable & fast.It
doesn't come with any closed source codec's or drivers but any way you
can install them later.Fedora has many spins.One of the famous
derivative is FEL(Fedora Electronic Lab).FEL contains all software's for
electronic design & simulation.Fedora has some support to ARM devices
too.

 

 

 

\ **Number Two:  (UBUNTU)**\ 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image3|           The most beloved distribution of recent times.Based
on rock solid \ `Debian`_ (deb).`Ubuntu`_ release twice in a year.This
frequent  distribution combined with large hardware support makes this a
must go for all.Ubuntu comes pre installed with many laptops & netbooks.
Its becoming an industry trend to make drivers available for Ubuntu
platform.It has excellent support for ARM(mobile & tablets) devices.Many
tablets now run exclusively Ubuntu.Easy installation & decent looks
makes it popular among new users.With 'Unity' Desktop, Ubuntu has shown
new breed of Gnome & KDE.

 

 

\ **Number ONE:  (Linux Mint)**\ 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image4|\ This is the best Linux Distribution for any newbie or
techie.\ `Linux Mint`_ is based on Ubuntu Linux.So all goodies are
automatically inherited.So what else? Why its so special ? The best
thing of the Mint Desktop is its completeness.You merely have to install
any other package.It has all multimedia packages,DVD support to Flash
for browser.It comes with VLC, MPlayer and many other handy tools.It has
community support versions for KDE,XFCE,LXDE also.With increasing rank
in Distrowatch, I suggest all to at least give it a try.

 

 

Please don't take this post as pro ubuntu.I love many distributions.Call
me crazy, but I personally use 3 Linux distro's at a time.My other
favorites are `Simply Mepis`_, `Arch`_,\ `Slackware`_,& \ `Bodhi
Linux`_.More precisely Bodhi is unique,as it comes with less known but
mature \ `enlightenment`_ Desktop environment.

Any way please share your thoughts.May be i can change the order based
on your vote.But please keep in mind this article is to motivate people
for free & open source World,so let's not scare with advanced comments.
