Newbies often get confused with the concept of GNU and Linux. Most
people end up saying GNU/Linux as 'Linux'. The important thing here to
understand is most people don't directly use Linux. This may sound
contradict but Linux is just a core part of an operating system. It's
task is to handle underlying hardware.

Users work on application, and applications can't talk directly to
hardware, they take help of Linux-kernel. Major Free and Open source
applications(Libre Office, VLC media player etc.) are licensed under GNU
License. In fact the basic core-utils packages used in Linux like copy,
move etc. are GNU applications.
