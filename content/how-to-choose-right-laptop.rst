This is a kind of question which everyone claims they know.Lets see.

Before you trust the marketing mantra's its better to know some basic
facts.

-  **Know Your Requirement** : This is most important.You shouldn't
   carry a graphic designer's lappy on your back.Look for the processor
   which suits your requirement.An intel core2duo can be enough for any
   programmer,office carrier or personal buisness.I would recommend
   corei3 & i5 for people who need to edit video's and do extensive
   graphics work.

-  **Compatibility with your present hardware:**  Before looking for new
   machine,find out if its compatible with your present hardware.For
   instance some old printers may not work with your Windows 7,few
   graphics cards have less support in Linux .

-  **Look for better battery life** : Most of the time you will with
   power adapter but one should always keep in mind the battery life
   too.Anything more than 4 hrs backup is good.

-  **RAM Capacity :**\ Believe me,more RAM doesn't always mean more
   speed.Speed depends on CPU speed & bus,L1,L2 Cache,hard drive and in
   some cases Operating system too.RAM is a temprorary storage which is
   closure to CPU for faster data access.If you're not a graphic
   designer or animator trust me 2 GB is more than enough.

-  **Go for high capacity Hard Drive** : Believe it or not you will be
   complaining about the hard drive capacity sooner or later.So its
   better to start with atleast 350 GB .I assume you're human & store
   some movies and songs.

-  **Go for extended warranty :**\ Ask your vendor for extended
   warranty.If you're lucky enough you will get 2 year extension for
   almost nothing.

With these six simple steps in mind i'm sure you will not spend those
extra bugs on your laptop which you will never use.That money you can
spend or invest somewhere better.

Ask me any doubt you have or post a question.
