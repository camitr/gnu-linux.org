If you want simple,fast and easy way to develop PCBs,then the answer is
Fritzing. Its an opensource Schemetic and PCB designing tool. All one
need to design is simple circuits on virtual breadbroad. The connections
on breadboards are converted into schematic and PCB in real time.

One can order the PCBs made by fritzing online at very affordable price.
Here are some screen shots. I will post few tutorials very soon.
