| In many embedded devices such as beagleboard, pandaboard, olimex etc
Linux boots
|  entirely from sdcard, many times we run out of RAM and obviously
forget to add
|  swap space during installation. The simplest way would be resizing
the existing rootfs
|  partition and make a new partition of desired space to accommodate
swap.

Add following lines to ``/etc/rc.local`` assuming you have similar nodes
in ``/dev/`` for sdcard

.. code:: literal-block

    mkswap /dev/mmcblk0p3
    swapon /dev/mmcblk0p3

| Here mmcblk0p3 is the newly created partition from existing ext4/ext3
rootfs partition. This
|  is a dirty but quick hack to add swap to your existing image.
