Today KDE released updates for its Workspaces, Applications, and
Development Platform. These updates are the first in a series of monthly
stabilization updates to the 4.8 series. 4.8.1 updates bring many
bugfixes and translation updates on top of the latest edition in the 4.8
series and are recommended updates for everyone running 4.8.0 or earlier
versions. As the release only contains bugfixes and translation updates,
it will be a safe and pleasant update for everyone. KDEâ€™s software is
already translated into more than 55 languages, with more to come. The
March updates contain many performance improvements and bugfixes for
applications using the Nepomuk semantic framework. `Read more.`_
